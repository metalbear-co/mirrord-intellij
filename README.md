mirrord lets developers run local processes in the context of their cloud environment.
Itâ€™s meant to provide the benefits of running your service on a cloud environment (e.g. staging) without actually
going through the hassle of deploying it there, and without disrupting the environment by deploying untested code.
It comes as a Visual Studio Code extension, an IntelliJ plugin and a CLI tool. You can read more about it [here](https://mirrord.dev/docs/overview/introduction/).

This repository is for the IntelliJ plugin.
mirrord main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/metalbear-co/mirrord).
